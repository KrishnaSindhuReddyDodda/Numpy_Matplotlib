1) Which age groups often tested for electro-cardiographic testing using horizantal bar graph?
2) min and max age groups with heart stroke in this dataset.
3) Finding frequency of chest pains as per age groups using scatter plot.
4) Finding average cholestrol level, mean and Standard Deviation of resting Blood Pressure for all age groups in combined.
